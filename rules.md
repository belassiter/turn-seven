# Objective of the Game
Flip 7 is a push-your-luck party card game where players take turns drawing cards from a central deck, trying to collect the highest possible score each round without going bust. The main objective is to be the first player to reach 200 points across multiple rounds.

Players earn points by collecting Number cards during their turn. You can stop your turn at any time and keep your accumulated cards and points, or you can keep drawing to try to earn more. However, if you draw a Number card that matches one you already have, you bust and score zero for that round.

There’s also a special bonus: if you successfully collect 7 unique Number cards during your turn, you instantly end the round and earn an additional 15-point bonus, regardless of what other players have.

# Components

## Number Cards:
Each Number card is worth its face value in points. The higher the number, the more of that card exist in the deck.

- 12 cards showing the number 12
- 11 cards showing the number 11
- … continuing downward …
- 2 cards showing the number 2
- 1 card showing the number 1
- 1 card showing the number 0 (worth zero points but counts toward 7 unique numbers)
This distribution means high numbers are more likely to appear, while low numbers are rare and risky to chase.

## Modifier Cards:
- +2, +4, +6, +8, +10: Adds that number of points to your total for the round
- x2: Doubles your current score before applying other modifiers
Modifier cards are not Number cards and do not count toward the 7-unique-card bonus.

## Action Cards:
- Freeze! (x3)
- Flip Three! (x3)
- Second Chance (x3)
These cards interrupt the normal flow of the game and introduce tactical decisions and surprise outcomes.

# Setup
Shuffle all cards thoroughly to form a central draw pile.
Choose one player to be the Dealer. This role rotates clockwise after each round.
Works with 3-18 players
You’re now ready to begin play.

# Dealing the Cards
At the start of each round:

The Dealer deals one card at a time to each player, including themselves.
If a player is dealt an Action card, resolve its effect immediately before continuing to deal the next card.
Continue dealing until every player has received at least one card.
Due to the nature of Action cards, it’s possible that some players may receive multiple cards or none during the initial deal.

# Player Turns
Starting with the player to the Dealer’s left and proceeding clockwise, each active player (i.e., a player who hasn’t busted or stayed) takes their turn.

Each turn, a player chooses between two actions:

1. Hit (Draw a Card)
- Draw one card at a time from the deck.
- Place any Number cards in a row in front of you. These are your scoring cards for the round.
- Place Modifier cards above your row. They do not count toward the 7 unique Number cards.
- Action cards are resolved immediately.
You may continue drawing as long as you want, but beware:

- If you draw a Number card that matches a number already in your line, you bust and your turn ends. You score zero points for the round.
- If you successfully collect 7 unique Number cards, you end the round immediately and receive a 15-point bonus in addition to the total value of your cards and modifiers.
2. Stay (End Your Turn)
- You may choose to end your turn voluntarily before drawing.
- You keep all your cards and score the total value of your Number cards and any applicable Modifier cards.
- Once you stay, you are out of the round and cannot draw or be targeted by Action cards.

# Special Cards: Actions
## Freeze!
- Target any active player (including yourself if you’re the only one left).
- That player must immediately end their turn. They keep any cards collected so far and score as if they had chosen to Stay.
## Flip Three!
- Target an active player.
- That player must immediately draw the next three cards, resolving them one at a time.
  - Number cards go into their row as usual.
  - Modifier cards are placed above the row.
  - Action cards (like Second Chance) are set aside to be used later.
- If the player busts during these three cards, their turn ends and they score zero.
- If the player reaches 7 unique Number cards during this forced flip, the round ends immediately and the bonus is awarded.
- If another Action card like Flip Three or Freeze is revealed during the process, it is not resolved immediately—wait until the 3-card sequence is completed.
## Second Chance
- This card protects the player from busting once.
- If you draw a Number card that duplicates one already in your line:
  - Discard the duplicate and the Second Chance card.
  - Continue your turn as normal.
- You may only hold one Second Chance card at a time.
- If dealt a second copy, give it to any active player who doesn’t already have one. If no eligible players exist, discard the extra card.
- All unused Second Chance cards are discarded at the end of the round.

# Modifier Cards
Modifier cards affect scoring but do not help you reach the 7-card bonus and do not cause you to bust.

## +2 through +10
- Simply add this number to your score after calculating your Number card total.
## x2 Card
- Doubles the sum of your Number cards only, before adding +X modifiers.

# End of Round
A round ends immediately if any of the following occurs:

1. A player successfully collects 7 unique Number cards
→ That player ends the round instantly and earns a 15-point bonus
2. All players have either busted or chosen to Stay
→ No more actions can be taken; scoring phase begins

# Scoring
- If you busted, you score zero points.
If you stayed or were forced to Freeze, score the total value of your Number cards and add any Modifier cards (x2 first, then +X).
If you flipped 7 unique Number cards, add the 15-point bonus to your total for the round.
Unused Second Chance cards are discarded.

# End of Game
- The game ends when at least one player’s total score reaches 200 or more points at the end of a round.
- Ties can be broken with a sudden-death tiebreaker round.
- If multiple players cross 200 in the same round, the player with the highest total score wins.
