#tl;dr

- Each turn, choose Hit or Stay. Hit draws a card, Stay ends your play for the round and collects your score.
- If you get a twin of one of your Number cards--bust! You score zero and are out for the round.
- If you collect seven unique Number cards, you achieve Turn 7! The round ends for everyone, and you get 15 bonus points.
- There are bonus cards (+2, x2, etc) that add to your score but do not contribute to busting or achieving Turn 7.
- There are action cards that can advantage you, or disadvantage your opponents
- The game is over after a round where a player accululates 200 points

# Objective of the Game

Hit or Stay, but don't bust! Your objective is reach 200 points and have the highest score.

You earn points based on the cards you collect during the round. On any turn you can choose to Stay and collect your score, or Hit and press your luck. Whenever you collect a twin of a Number card, you bust! Which means you collect nothing for the round.

Keep pressing your luck and you might achieve a Turn 7, with seven different Number cards, earning 15 bonus points and ending the round.

# The Deck

## Number Cards:

Each Number card scores its face value; however, it also has more twins in the deck.

- Twelve 12s
- Eleven 11s
- etc
- One 1
- One 0
  Higher Number cards have a better score, but they are also riskier!

## Bonus Cards:

- +2, +4, +6, +8, +10: Adds this many bonus points
- x2: Doubles the score from Number cards
  These cards provide bonus points, but do not count as Number cards in terms of Turn 7 or busting.

## Action Cards:

- Lock (x3)
- Turn Three (x3)
- Life Saver (x3)
  Action cards have special effects which a player can use to their own benefit or the detriment of others.

# Getting started

At the start of each round:

- Each player is dealt a card
- Action Cards are resolved before dealing the next card
- When each player has at least one card, the round begins

# Player Turns

The player has two choices on their turn:

1. Hit

- Draw a card
- An Action Card is resolved immediately
- If the drawn card is a twin of a Number card in their hand already, bust! Turn ends and score is zero for the round.
- If the drawn card is the 7th unique Number card, TURN 7! The round ends immediately and this player receives 15 bonus points.

2. Stay

- Exit the round safely.
- Collect your score.
- Action cards can no longer be applied to you

# Special Cards: Actions

## Lock

- Target any active player (including yourself if you’re the only one left).
- That player must immediately end their turn. They keep any cards collected so far and score as if they had chosen to Stay.

## Turn Three

- Target an active player.
- That player must immediately draw the next three cards, resolving them one at a time.
  - Number cards go into their row as usual.
  - Modifier cards are placed above the row.
  - Action cards (like Life Saver) are set aside to be used later.
- If the player busts during these three cards, their turn ends and they score zero.
- If the player reaches 7 unique Number cards during this forced turn, the round ends immediately and the bonus is awarded.
- If another Action card like Turn Three or Lock is revealed during the process, it is not resolved immediately—wait until the 3-card sequence is completed.

## Life Saver

- This card protects the player from busting once.
- If you draw a Number card that duplicates one already in your line:
  - Discard the duplicate and the Life Saver card.
  - Continue your turn as normal.
- You may only hold one Life Saver card at a time.
- If dealt a second copy, give it to any active player who doesn’t already have one. If no eligible players exist, discard the extra card.
- All unused Life Saver cards are discarded at the end of the round.

# Modifier Cards

Modifier cards affect scoring but do not help you reach the 7-card bonus and do not cause you to bust.

## +2 through +10

- Simply add this number to your score after calculating your Number card total.

## x2 Card

- Doubles the sum of your Number cards only, before adding +X modifiers.

# End of Round

A round ends immediately if any of the following occurs:

1. A player successfully collects 7 unique Number cards
   → That player ends the round instantly and earns a 15-point bonus
2. All players have either busted or chosen to Stay
   → No more actions can be taken; scoring phase begins

# Scoring

- If you busted, you score zero points.
  If you stayed or were forced to Lock, score the total value of your Number cards and add any Modifier cards (x2 first, then +X).
  If you turned 7 unique Number cards, add the 15-point bonus to your total for the round.
  Unused Life Saver cards are discarded.

# STARTING THE NEXT ROUND

- Set all cards from the round in the discard pile. Do not shuffle them back into the deck.
- When the deck runs out, shuffle all the discarded cards to form a new deck. If you need to reshuffle mid-round, leave all cards in front of players where they are, even if that player has busted and is out of the round.

# End of Game

- The game ends when at least one player’s total score reaches 200 or more points at the end of a round.
- Ties can be broken with a sudden-death tiebreaker round.
- If multiple players cross 200 in the same round, the player with the highest total score wins.
