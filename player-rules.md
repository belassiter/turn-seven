#tl;dr

- Each turn, choose Hit or Stay. Hit draws a card, Stay ends your play for the round and collects your score.
- If you get a twin of one of your Number cards--bust! You score zero and are out for the round.
- If you collect seven unique Number cards, you achieve Turn 7! The round ends, and you get 15 bonus points.
- There are bonus cards (+2, x2, etc) that add to your score but do not contribute to busting or achieving Turn 7.
- 

# Objective of the Game

Hit or Stay, but don't bust! Your objective is reach 200 points and have the highest score.

You earn points based on the cards you collect during the round. On any turn you can choose to Stay and collect your score, or Hit and press your luck. Whenever you collect a twin of a Number card, you bust! Which means you collect nothing for the round.

Keep pressing your luck and you might achieve a Turn 7, with seven different Number cards, earning 15 bonus points and ending the round.

# The Deck

## Number Cards:

Each Number card scores its face value; however, it also has more twins in the deck.

- Twelve 12s
- Eleven 11s
- etc
- One 1
- One 0
  Higher Number cards have a better score, but they are also riskier!

## Bonus Cards:

- +2, +4, +6, +8, +10: Adds this many bonus points
- x2: Doubles the score from Number cards
  These cards provide bonus points, but do not count as Number cards in terms of Turn 7 or busting.

## Action Cards:

- Lock (x3)
- Turn Three (x3)
- Life Saver (x3)
  Action cards have special effects which a player can use to their own benefit or the detriment of others.

# Getting started

At the start of each round:

- Each player is dealt a card
- Action Cards are resolved before dealing the next card
- When each player has at least one card, the round begins

# Player Turns

The player has two choices on their turn:

1. Hit

- Draw a card
- An Action Card is resolved immediately
- If the drawn card is a twin of a Number card in their hand already, bust! Turn ends and score is zero for the round.
- If the drawn card is the 7th unique Number card, TURN 7! The round ends immediately and this player receives 15 bonus points.

2. Stay

- Exit the round safely.
- Collect your score.
- Action cards can no longer be applied to you

# Special Cards: Actions

## Lock

- Target any active player (including yourself if you’re the only one left).
- That player must immediately end their turn. They keep any cards collected so far and score as if they had chosen to Stay.

## Turn Three

- Target an active player.
- That player must immediately draw the next three cards, resolving them one at a time.
  - Number cards go into their row as usual.
  - Modifier cards are placed above the row.
  - Action cards (like Life Saver) are set aside to be used later.
- If the player busts during these three cards, their turn ends and they score zero.
- If the player reaches 7 unique Number cards during this forced turn, the round ends immediately and the bonus is awarded.
- If another Action card like Turn Three or Lock is revealed during the process, it is not resolved immediately—wait until the 3-card sequence is completed.

## Life Saver

- This card protects the player from busting once.
- If you draw a Number card that duplicates one already in your line:
  - Discard the duplicate and the Life Saver card.
  - Continue your turn as normal.
- You may only hold one Life Saver card at a time.
- If dealt a second copy, give it to any active player who doesn’t already have one. If no eligible players exist, discard the extra card.
- All unused Life Saver cards are discarded at the end of the round.

# Modifier Cards

Modifier cards affect scoring but do not help you reach the 7-card bonus and do not cause you to bust.

## +2 through +10

- Simply add this number to your score after calculating your Number card total.

## x2 Card

- Doubles the sum of your Number cards only, before adding +X modifiers.

# End of Round

A round ends immediately if any of the following occurs:

1. A player successfully collects 7 unique Number cards
   → That player ends the round instantly and earns a 15-point bonus
2. All players have either busted or chosen to Stay
   → No more actions can be taken; scoring phase begins

# Scoring

- If you busted, you score zero points.
  If you stayed or were forced to Lock, score the total value of your Number cards and add any Modifier cards (x2 first, then +X).
  If you turned 7 unique Number cards, add the 15-point bonus to your total for the round.
  Unused Life Saver cards are discarded.

# STARTING THE NEXT ROUND

- Set all cards from the round in the discard pile. Do not shuffle them back into the deck.
- When the deck runs out, shuffle all the discarded cards to form a new deck. If you need to reshuffle mid-round, leave all cards in front of players where they are, even if that player has busted and is out of the round.

# End of Game

- The game ends when at least one player’s total score reaches 200 or more points at the end of a round.
- Ties can be broken with a sudden-death tiebreaker round.
- If multiple players cross 200 in the same round, the player with the highest total score wins.

# Edge Cases

From https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/292492/flip-7-faq-edge-cases (v1.5)
Case 1: You are dealt a matching number card and go bust, so you are out of the round. What do you do with your cards?
Answer: Leave your cards in front of yourself, but turn them face-down to signify that you are out of the round. At the
end of the round (i.e. when there are no active players left), place all your cards in the discard pile.
Case 2: During the initial deal of one card to everyone, you are dealt a Lock card. Do you assign this card to another
player right away? If so, can you assign it to a player who hasn’t yet been dealt any cards?
Answer: Yes, you must assign the Lock card right away, and yes, you can assign it to any player, even one who has not
yet been dealt their first card by the dealer. This means that a player can be out of the round before even getting started
in the round. (But don’t worry – there will be many other rounds!)
Case 3: You get dealt a Lock card and need to assign it. Can you assign a Lock card to yourself if you wish?
Answer: Yes.
Case 4: You are assigned a Lock card and hence, you are locked and out of the round. What happens to the Lock card
now? Is it discarded right away, or is it left face-up on the table? And, what happens to your other cards? Are they turned
face down until the end of the round, or are they left face-up?
Answer: Both the Lock card and your other cards remain face-up on the table in front of you for the rest of the round.
(This answer is confirmed in this BGG thread.) At the end of the round you will score your cards.
Case 5: You have used a Life Saver card to neutralize a number card that would have busted you. Is your turn done?
Or does the neutralization make it as if you never received the busting card at all, so the dealer should again ask you “Hit
or stay”?
Answer: Your turn is done. The dealer should ask “Hit or stay?” to the next person in line.
Case 6: You have used a Life Saver card to neutralize a duplicate number card that would have busted you. What
happens to the Life Saver card and the duplicate number card?
Answer: You immediately place the Life Saver card and the duplicate number card on the discard pile. (You leave
the original counterpart of the duplicate number card still face-up on the table, as one of your current number cards.)
Case 7: You have a Life Saver card but the round ends before you get to use it. (This could happen, say, if you are
assigned a Lock card, or if another player achieves a round-ending Flip 7.) Do you get to keep this Life Saver card
so you can use it in the next round?
Answer: No. Your unused Life Saver card is discarded at the end of the round.
Case 8: You have a Life Saver card. You are dealt another Life Saver card. Can you keep it?
Answer: No. A player can have at most ONE Life Saver card. You must assign the extra Life Saver card to an
active player who does not already have a Life Saver card. If there is no active player without a Life Saver card
left in the round, then you must discard the extra Life Saver card.
Case 9: There is a tie for highest score greater than or equal to 200. What do we do?
Answer: Everyone (not just the tied players) plays another round. The person with the highest score after this new round
wins. (The winner can be a player who was not tied for high score in the previous round.) If there is a new tie, play yet
another round. Keep playing rounds until there is a unique high score greater than or equal to 200.
Case 10: You receive the orange “x2” modifier card. Does this card also double your “+” modifier cards?
Answer: No. The “x2” only doubles your usual number cards (i.e. the colored number cards you can go bust with). It does
NOT double the “+2”, “+4”, etc., cards. (In practice, when computing your score, you should sum your usual number
cards first, then apply the “x2” modifier card if you have it, and only after this add any “+x” orange modifier cards that
you also have.) For instance, if you end the round with 7, 11, +8, and x2, you score 44 ( = [7+11]x2, then +8).
Case 11: The round ends with you possessing only modifier cards (i.e. the orange “+” cards and/or the “x2” card). That is,
you possess none of the usual colored number cards 0-12. (This could happen, say, if you receive a Lock card or if
another player achieves a round-ending Flip 7.) Do you score anything at all for this round?
Answer: Yes, you get to score all orange “+” modifier cards you have. The “x2” card, however, scores nothing, since it
only applies to the usual number cards (see Case 10 above), and you have none of those cards. (Example: You end the
round with only the +2, +6, and x2 cards. Your score for the round is 8.)
Case 12: You are assigned and resolve a Flip 3 card. What happens to this Flip 3 card? Is that card discarded now, or is it
left face-up on the table in front of you for the rest of the round?
Answer: A Flip 3 card is placed in the discard pile immediately after resolving the Flip 3 process. (This is true whether this
process ends with a bust, a Flip 7, or three non-busting cards). (This rule is confirmed in this BGG thread.)
Case 13: You receive a Lock or Flip 3 card, but you are the only active player left in the round. Do you have to assign
this card to yourself?
Answer: Yes.
Case 14 (a “Chained Flip 3” scenario): While flipping cards during the resolution of a Flip 3 card, you draw another Flip 3
card. What happens to this new Flip 3 card?
Answer: The new Flip 3 card is set aside until the initial Flip 3 process has been fully resolved, i.e. until three cards have
been successfully drawn, or the flipping player goes bust or achieves a Flip 7. (The new Flip 3 card counts toward the
target of three cards drawn.) If the player goes bust, then the new Flip 3 card is NOT used; discard it along with the
original Flip 3 card.(Note: this is an official rule change from the original printing of the game, as noted in the BGG post
from the publisher here.) If the player completes a Flip 7, then the round ends immediately for all players and the new
Flip 3 card is discarded along with the original Flip 3 card. If the initial Flip 3 card is resolved without busting or achieving
3
a Flip 7, then the new Flip 3 card that had been set aside is now assigned to an owner. The player can choose to assign
the new Flip 3 card to himself / herself, or the player can choose to assign the new Flip 3 card to another active player. (If
the player who resolved the Flip 3 is the only active player remaining, then this player must assign the new Flip 3 card to
himself / herself.) Once the new Flip 3 card has been assigned an owner, the original Flip 3 card is discarded. The original
Flip 3 resolution is now complete, so the owner of the new Flip 3 card now resolves that card.
Case 15: While flipping cards during the resolution of a Flip 3 card, you draw a Lock card. What happens to this?
Answer: This is handled in the same manner as drawing another Flip 3 card during a Flip 3 resolution (as explained above
in Case 14) – namely, the Lock card is set aside until the Flip 3 has been fully resolved. If the player goes bust or
completes a Flip 7, the Lock card and the original Flip 3 card are discarded. Otherwise, after the Flip 3 is done, the
player assigns the Lock card to any active player and then discards the original Flip 3 card. (If the player who resolved
the Flip 3 is the only active player remaining, then this player must assign the card to himself / herself.)
Case 16: While resolving a Flip 3 card, you draw more than one Lock or Flip 3 card; you set each of these aside
temporarily. You successfully resolve the Flip 3 process without busting or Flipping 7. It’s now time to assign the action
cards that you set aside. In what order are these cards assigned, and when do they take effect?
Answer: You assign the cards in the order in which they were flipped. (This answer is confirmed by a representative of the
publisher [Alyssa] in this BGG thread.) You may assign multiple cards to one active player, or to multiple active players as
you see fit. (If you are the only active player remaining, then you must assign all the cards to yourself.) No assigned card
takes effect until after all the cards have been assigned. After all the cards have been assigned to their owners, they then
take effect one by one in sequence, in the order in which they were assigned.
Case 16 special sub-cases:
(a) If a single player is assigned, first, a Lock, and second, a Flip 3, then after being locked, that player discards the
Flip 3 card.
(b) If a single player is assigned two Flip 3s, then proceed as follows: If there is a bust or Flip 7 with Flip 3 card #1,
then discard Flip 3 card #2. If there is no bust or Flip 7 with card #1, then that player must now resolve card #2 by
flipping new cards, i.e. that player does NOT get to assign card #2 to someone else.
(c) In a rarest-of-rare case, suppose that while resolving Flip 3 card #1, Player A draws a new Flip 3 card #2, a Lock
card, and a number card that causes neither a bust nor a Flip 7. Player A assigns Flip 3 card #2 to Player B and the
Lock card to Player C; A then discards Flip 3 card #1. Player B’s Flip 3 card #2 now takes effect, before C’s Lock
card takes effect. While resolving Flip 3 card #2, Player B draws a new Flip 3 card #3 and two numbers which
cause neither a bust nor a Flip 7 for B. Can Player B now assign Flip 3 card #3 to Player C, despite there being a
Lock card in front of C? The answer is YES, since C’s Lock card has not yet taken effect. After B assigns Flip 3
card #3 to C, B discards Flip 3 card #2, thereby completing card #2’s resolution. Next, C’s Lock card takes effect,
and – since C is now locked – C discards Flip 3 card #3 .
Case 17: During the initial deal of one card to everyone, you are dealt a Flip 3. How is this handled?
Answer: You must assign the card an owner right away. You can assign the card to yourself if you wish, in which case you
resolve the card immediately (i.e. you flip new cards until you reach three cards or you go bust). Or if you wish, you can
assign the Flip 3 to any other active player, in which case that player resolves the card immediately. As usual, if the player
who is drawing the cards goes bust, they are out of the round. Also as usual, if one of the newly flipped cards is itself a
Flip 3 card, then the player should handle this second Flip 3 card as described in Case 14 above.
Case 18: At the start of the game, you got assigned a Flip 3 card by another player before you even got dealt your initial
card by the dealer. You did not go bust in the Flip 3 process. When the initial deal resumes and the dealer reaches you,
must you automatically be dealt an additional card whether you want one or not, namely, must you be dealt the “initial”
card you have not yet been dealt by the dealer?
Answer: In a BGG forum thread, two people from the publisher [Alyssa and Matthieu] said “No”; the dealer should
instead ask you, “Hit or stay?” Taking a card during the initial deal is optional for you, since you have already been dealt
cards via the Flip 3 process, i.e. you can now say “Stay” to the dealer if you wish.
Case 19: A player is dealt a Flip 3 card; that player assigns the card to someone else, who then resolves it. Whose turn is it
next to be asked by the dealer “Hit or Stay”? Is it the turn of the player who is clockwise after the player who just finished
flipping the three cards? Or is it the turn of the player who is clockwise after the player who initially got dealt the Flip 3
card?
Answer: It is the turn of the player who is immediately clockwise after the player who initially got dealt the Flip 3 card.
That is, the dealer should remember which player initially got dealt the Flip 3 card; after the Flip 3 card is resolved, the
dealer should then ask “Hit or stay?” to the player who is clockwise next in turn after the player who initially got dealt the
Flip 3 card. This is the case even in a “Chained Flip 3” scenario (see Case 14 above). For instance, imagine a game between
players A, B, C, and D. Player A receives a Flip 3 card #1 and assigns it to C. During the flipping of three cards, C flips over a
Flip 3 card #2. C resolves Flip 3 card #1 without busting or completing a Flip 7, and then assigns Flip 3 card #2 to D. After D
resolves Flip 3 card #2, the dealer asks “Hit or Stay?” to B, who was next in turn after Player A, the player who got dealt Flip
3 card #1.
Case 20: While flipping cards during the resolution of a Flip 3 card, on your first or second draw, you draw a number card
that matches a card that you already possess, and thus you go bust. Do you go ahead and draw further cards, so that
three cards in total are still drawn?
Answer: No. You go bust immediately. You draw no further cards. You participate no further in the current round.
Case 21: While flipping cards during the resolution of a Flip 3 card, on your first or second flip, you draw a card that
completes a Flip 7 for you. Must you still draw further cards, so that three cards in total are drawn?
Answer: No. Upon completion of a Flip 7, the round ends immediately for you and everyone else. No further cards are
drawn.
Case 22: You are resolving a Flip 3 card. Before the start of the Flip 3 resolution, you already possessed a Life Saver
card from a previous turn. While resolving the Flip 3 card, you draw a number that matches an existing card. Can you use
the Life Saver card against the matching number card, to stop yourself from busting?
Answer: Yes.
Case 23: You are resolving a Flip 3 card. Before the start of the Flip 3 resolution, you already possessed a Life Saver
card from a previous turn. While resolving the Flip 3 card, you draw a Life Saver card as one of your three cards.
What happens to this card?
5
Answer: Since you already have a previous Life Saver card, you cannot keep the newly drawn Life Saver card –
a player can never have more than one Life Saver card. (The drawn card still counts toward the target total of three
cards, however.) You must assign the card immediately to another active player. If you are the only active player left in
the round, then you must discard the newly drawn Life Saver card. (This answer is confirmed by a representative of
the publisher [Alyssa] in this BGG thread.)
Case 24: While resolving a Flip 3 card, you draw a Life Saver card. You do not have a Life Saver card already
from a previous turn. May you keep the newly drawn Life Saver card? And if so, may you use this Life Saver
card later in the same Flip 3 resolution to stop yourself from busting if you draw a number that matches an existing card?
Answer: Yes, you may keep the newly drawn Life Saver card, and yes, you may use this card if needed later in the
same Flip 3 process to stop yourself from busting. (Note, then, that unlike a Flip 3 or Lock card that is drawn during a
Flip 3 resolution, a Life Saver card that is drawn during a Flip 3 resolution does NOT have to be set aside until after
the Flip 3 process concludes.) If no matching number card is drawn in the Flip 3 process, then you may still keep the
drawn Life Saver card for possible use later in the round.
Below is a summary of play for Flip 3 cards that compiles together in one place the most common edge cases.
A Step-by-Step Flip 3 Procedure List
You are dealt a Flip 3 card by the dealer. You can choose to assign this card to yourself or to any other active player. (If you
are the only active player left in the round, then you MUST assign the Flip 3 card to yourself.) Whoever is assigned the Flip
3 card should then follow the procedure below. (Note that all flipped cards – even flipped action cards and orange
modifier cards [“+2”, etc.] – count toward the target of flipping 3 cards.)

1. Flip three cards, one at a time. Stop immediately if you Bust or Flip 7, and put the Flip 3 card on the discard pile. If
   you Flip 7, the round ends immediately for ALL players and you go straight to scoring the round.
2. If you draw a Life Saver card, then:
   • If you don't already have one, immediately assign it to yourself.
   • If you do already have one, then immediately assign the new one to another active player. (If you are the only
   active player left, then discard it.)
   During a Flip 3 procedure, you are allowed to use a Life Saver card in your possession – whether newly drawn
   or previously owned – to neutralize a number card that would otherwise bust you.
3. Temporarily set aside any Flip 3s or Locks you draw. Discard them if you subsequently Bust or Flip 7.
4. After flipping all three required cards without Busting or Flipping 7:
   • If no Flip 3s or Locks were set aside, discard the original Flip 3 card. The Flip 3 resolution is now complete.
   • If any Flip 3s or Locks were set-aside, then assign these in the order they were flipped, and to whichever
   active player(s) you choose. (You may assign multiple cards to the same player, or to different players at your
   discretion. If you are the only active player remaining, however, then you must assign all the cards to yourself.)
   Next, discard the original Flip 3 card; its resolution is now complete. Assigned Locks and Flip 3s then take
   effect sequentially, in the order in which you handed them out.
5. After the original Flip 3 and any other subsequent Flip 3 and Lock cards are all resolved, the Dealer then moves
   along to the next active player clockwise from the player who got dealt the original Flip 3 by the Dealer, and asks that
   next player if they wish to "Hit or Stay?"
   6
   Some general principles to help with resolving edge cases:
   • The dealer always asks “Hit or stay?” strictly in turn order, i.e. no one’s turn is ever skipped.
   • All Lock and Flip 3 cards are assigned and fully resolved prior to the next asking of “Hit or stay?” by the dealer.
   • If you must assign a Lock or Flip 3 card, and you are the only active player left, then you must assign the card to
   yourself.
   • The assignment of a Lock card or a new Flip 3 card that is drawn during the resolution of a Flip 3 card takes place
   after the drawing of cards in the initial Flip 3 process, and only if that player did not go bust or achieve a Flip 7. By
   contrast, the assignment of a Life Saver card drawn during a Flip 3 process takes place immediately.
   • Remember: Flip 7 is a light-hearted party game meant to be played for fun. Truly confusing edge cases are rare, and
   you should feel free to depart from the official edge case solutions described in this FAQ by using your own house
   rules so long as all players agree
